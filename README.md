This is the main repository used for Robot Programming Group 1.1

Each member (or members) will have their own branch to which they can push/pull files.

Inside each branch there is a `src` folder containing a package in which you **must** keep all your files!

**Do not** tinker with other people's branches if they do not give permission to do so!

If you do, then Theo will be forced to get the whip out, and it won't be nice... (unless you're into this sort of stuff)
