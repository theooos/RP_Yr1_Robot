This is the main repository used for Robot Programming Group 1.1

Each member (or members) will have their own package to which they can push/pull files.

DO NOT tinker with other people's package if they do not give permission to do so!

If you do, then Theo will be forced to get the whip out, and it won't be nice... (unless you're into this sort of stuff)
