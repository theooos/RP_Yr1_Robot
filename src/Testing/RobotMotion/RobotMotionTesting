Robot Motion Control Test Run

Test1: Long sequence of moves

Move sequence used: FORWARD,RIGHT,LEFT,LEFT,RIGHT,FORWARD,RIGHT,LEFT,LEFT,FORWARD,FORWARD,LEFT,
	      FORWARD,FORWARD,FORWARD,FORWARD,FORWARD,LEFT,FORWARD,LEFT

Total number of runs: 8
Number of failed runs: 3

Run1=success
Run2=success
Run3=fail on first move
Run4=fail on first move
Run5=success
Run6=success
Run7=fail on second last move
Run8=success

Conclusion: *Robot always fails on the first move if not initially positioned correctly
	    *Robot sometimes fails mid-execution if there are certain dark spots on 
	     the map (detects a junction when it shouldn't)
	    *Robot sometimes fails mid-execution if there is not enough space to rotate properly

Test2: Backwards

Move sequence used: FORWARD,FORWARD,BACKWARDS

Total number of runs: 8
Number of failed runs: 2

Run1=fail on second move
Run2=fail on second move
--Restarted the program and tweaked light values after Run2--
Run3=success
Run4=success
Run5=success
Run6=success
Run7=success
Run8=success

Conclusion: *Robot always fails on the first move if not initially positioned correctly
	    *Robot sometimes fails mid-execution if there are certain dark spots on 
	     the map (detects a junction when it shouldn't)
	    *Robot sometimes fails mid-execution if there is not enough space to rotate properly

Test3: Wall detection

Move sequence used: FORWARD 

Total number of runs: 5
Number of fialed runs: 1

Conclusion: *Robot sometimes moves backwards too much and it misses the last visited junction
